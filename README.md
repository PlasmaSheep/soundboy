# Soundboy #

Soundboy is a manager for music. In the future, soundboy will be able to:

+ Sync your MPD library with your mp3 player
+ Automatically import, tag, and rename music files
+ Normalize files using replaygain tags
+ Convert files en masse

And perhaps more. Currently soundboy does not do much, but it can move your files to your music directory.
